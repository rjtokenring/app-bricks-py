"""Configure llama.cpp for the models installed in a directory.

Writes the models.ini preset the server is started with, and answers the two questions
run-model-router.sh asks before starting it: which context size the installed models can
hold (``--print-ctx``), and how many Hexagon sessions they need at that context
(``--print-ndev``). Those two modes print a single number on stdout and send every
diagnostic to stderr, so the caller can read the answer with a command substitution.

Usage:

# Hexagon session sizing
#
# A model is spread over the Hexagon sessions layer by layer: each session holds the
# weights of its layers, the slice of the KV cache that belongs to them, and its own
# compute buffers. Sizing it is a matter of keeping the busiest session under what the DSP
# will reliably map for one, which is not a single number — see ../SESSION_ALLOCATION.md,
# where loads succeeded holding 2.9 GiB and failed holding 1.8 GiB. Past the limit the
# load fails with
#
#   ggml-hex: HTP0 buffer mapping failed : domain_id 3 size 536883200 error 0x00000001
#   alloc_tensor_range: failed to allocate HTP0 buffer of size 536870912
#
# Before resizing anything over such a failure, check the board's free RAM: the DSP
# buffers come from plain system memory (/dev/dma_heap/system), so the same message
# also appears when the board is simply out of it. Measured: a loaded model
# costs about 1.6x its GGUF size in RAM.
