"""Configure llama.cpp for the models installed in a directory.

Writes the models.ini preset the server is started with, and answers the two questions
run-model-router.sh asks before starting it: which context size the installed models can
hold (``--print-ctx``), and how many Hexagon sessions they need at that context
(``--print-ndev``). Those two modes print a single number on stdout and send every
diagnostic to stderr, so the caller can read the answer with a command substitution.

Usage:
    python configure-llamacpp.py /models
    python configure-llamacpp.py /models --print-ctx --ctx 16384
    python configure-llamacpp.py /models --print-ndev --ctx 4096

# Hexagon session sizing
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# A Hexagon session maps about 1 GiB of repacked weights per DSP domain, so the number of
# sessions a model needs is driven by how much of it lands on the NPU, not by its parameter
# count: the repacked size ranges from roughly 44% to 103% of the GGUF depending on the
# architecture (token embeddings stay on the CPU, matformer models share a lot of weights).
# The parameter count is wrong in both directions, so size the sessions on the GGUF size.
#
# The KV cache is allocated on the same domains as the weights, so the sizing also depends
# on the context size: hence two tables, picked by ndev_table() below.
#
# Number of sessions by GGUF size, ordered from the largest threshold down: the first entry a
# model exceeds wins. Both tables are deliberately conservative — they over-allocate a session
# on some models, which costs ~3% per token, rather than failing to load; models with a
# known-good value should carry an explicit GGML_HEXAGON_NDEV instead.

# Default table, for the context sizes the service runs at out of the box.
