"""ONNX Runtime session factory with optional Qualcomm QNN (Hexagon NPU) acceleration.

This replaces the LiteRT `aihub.tf.load_qnn_delegate()` helper the other runners use.
Where TFLite reaches the NPU through an external delegate .so, ONNX Runtime reaches it
through the QNN execution provider, which ships in two flavours:

  * plugin EP (`onnxruntime-qnn` >= 2.x, maintained by Qualcomm) - a standalone wheel
    registered at runtime against a stock `onnxruntime` install. It is the only variant
    with Linux aarch64 wheels, so it is the one the container installs. The wheel is
    self-contained: it carries its own QAIRT (libQnnHtp.so, libQnnHtpPrepare.so and the
    libQnnHtpV*Skel.so DSP libraries), independent from the QAIRT in the base image.
  * bundled EP (`onnxruntime-qnn` 1.x, Windows arm64/x64) - ships QNN inside the ORT
    wheel itself and shows up directly in `ort.get_available_providers()`.

Both are handled here; the plugin is preferred and the bundled build is the fallback.

EASYOCR_QNN_PERF_MODE       sustained_high_performance (default), burst, balanced, ...
EASYOCR_QNN_FINALIZATION_MODE  0 (default, fastest compile) .. 3 (slowest compile)

    Open `model_path` on the best available execution provider.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model_path
        Path to the .onnx graph.
    backend
        "auto" (default) tries QNN and falls back to the CPU, "qnn" requires the NPU,
        "cpu" skips QNN entirely. Defaults to $EASYOCR_EP.
    intra_op_threads
        CPU thread count; 0/None leaves it to ORT.
    profile
        Enable ORT profiling on the session, so the caller can read back which provider
        actually executed which nodes. Stops as soon as `end_profiling()` is called.

    Returns
    -------

    provider : str
        Name of the provider the session actually landed on.
