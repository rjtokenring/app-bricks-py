"""HTTP transport to the arduino-cloud-connector daemon's localhost REST/SSE API.

The daemon owns the MQTT connection to Arduino Cloud; the brick only exchanges
variable values with it over two endpoints (RFC-13 §8):

* ``PUT /v1/variables/{name}`` with body ``{"value": <any>}`` — queue a value
  for ordered delivery to the cloud.
* ``GET /v1/variables/{name}/events`` — a Server-Sent Events stream. The first
  event is always one of three "sync" events telling the client how to seed its
  local value: ``thing_unavailable`` (no thing assigned yet), ``lastvalue`` (the
  variable's stored cloud value, replayed with ``last_value: true``) or
  ``lastvalue_missing`` (thing assigned, no cloud value). Once the cloud reaches
  steady state a ``lastvalue``/``lastvalue_missing`` resync frame follows for
  clients that connected while unprovisioned. Every subsequent live change is an
  ``event: update``. Each event's JSON payload is ``{name, value, timestamp,
  last_value}`` (``thing_unavailable``/``lastvalue_missing`` carry only ``name``).
