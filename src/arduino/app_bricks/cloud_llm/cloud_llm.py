        Args:
            api_key (str): The API access key for the target LLM service. Defaults to the
                'API_KEY' environment variable.
            model (Union[str, CloudModel]): The model identifier. Accepts a `CloudModel`
                enum member (e.g., `CloudModel.OPENAI_GPT`) or its corresponding raw string
                value (e.g., `'openai:gpt-5-mini'`). Defaults to `CloudModel.ANTHROPIC_CLAUDE`.
                To identify the model provider, you need to use prefixes like 'openai:', 'anthropic:', or 'google:'.
                If no prefix is provided, the model will be defaulted to an OpenAI compatible model.
            system_prompt (str): A system-level instruction that defines the AI's persona
                and constraints (e.g., "You are a helpful assistant"). Defaults to empty.
            temperature (Optional[float]): The sampling temperature between 0.0 and 1.0.
                Higher values make output more random/creative; lower values make it more
                deterministic. When ``None`` (default) no temperature is sent and each
                provider's own default is used; this also avoids errors on models that
                deprecated ``temperature`` (e.g. Anthropic Claude Sonnet 5+).
            reasoning_effort (ReasoningEffort | str | int | None): Optional default reasoning
                effort applied to every ``chat``/``chat_stream_reasoning`` call that does not
                pass its own. ``chat_stream`` is never affected: it always streams from the
                plain model (chat completions on OpenAI) and yields answer text only. When
                ``None`` (default) nothing is added and the plain model is used. When set, the
                reasoning-capable client (Responses API for OpenAI) is used so it works with
                tools. It is never forwarded as a raw model argument (which would break tool
                calling on OpenAI chat completions). Accepts a discrete level (`ReasoningEffort`
                / 'minimal'/'low'/'medium'/'high') or an integer token budget.
            max_tool_loops (int): The maximum number of consecutive tool-call loops
                allowed during a single chat interaction. Defaults to 8.
            timeout (Optional[int]): The maximum duration in seconds to wait for a response before
                timing out. Defaults to None.
            callbacks (Any): Optional callbacks for monitoring generation events.
            tools (Sequence[ToolLike]): BaseTool objects (from @tool or MCPClient.get_tools()) or plain
                callables (auto-wrapped into tools). Defaults to None. On OpenAI reasoning models
                from gpt-5.1 onwards, binding tools turns reasoning off on the plain path
                (``chat`` without an effort, ``chat_stream``), since chat completions rejects
                function tools while reasoning is active. To reason with tools, pass a
                ``reasoning_effort`` or use ``chat_stream_reasoning``, which go through the
                Responses API.
