# Large Language Model (LLMs) Brick

The Large Language Model (LLM) Brick provides functionality for interacting with locally-based LLMs such as Qwenm, LLama, Gemma. It wraps LangChain functionality to provide a simplified, unified interface for chatting with the local models. It supports both synchronous 'one-shot' responses and streaming output, with optional conversational memory.

## Overview

This Brick acts as a gateway to powerful AI models hosted locally. Whether you need a simple one-off answer or a continuous conversation with memory, the LLM Brick provides a unified API for different providers.

## Features

- **Multi-LLM Support**: Compatible with multiple LLM models including Qwen and Gemma. The default model used is different depending on the board that is used. Other models can be set and downloaded in Arduino App Labs.
- **Conversational Memory**: Built-in support for windowed history, allowing the AI to remember context from previous exchanges.
- **Streaming Responses**: Receive text chunks in real-time as they are generated, ideal for responsive user interfaces.
- **Configurable Behavior**: Customize system prompts, temperature (creativity), and request timeouts.

## Code Example and Usage

### Basic Conversation

This example initializes the Brick with an local model and performs a simple chat interaction. Models must be downloaded and available locally.

```python
from arduino.app_bricks.llm import LargeLanguageModel
from arduino.app_utils import App

llm = LargeLanguageModel()


def ask_prompt():
    prompt = "Hi, what can you do as an AI assistant?"
    print(llm.chat(prompt))
    print()
    raise StopIteration


App.run(ask_prompt)
```

### Streaming with Memory

This example demonstrates how to start a Local LLM chat with persistent memory.

```python
from arduino.app_bricks.cloud_llm import SQLMessagePersistence
from arduino.app_bricks.dbstorage_sqlstore import SQLStore
from arduino.app_bricks.llm import LargeLanguageModel
from arduino.app_utils import App

db = SQLStore("llm_persistent_demo.db")
db.start()

llm = LargeLanguageModel(
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant.",
).with_memory(
    max_messages=10,
    persistence=SQLMessagePersistence(sql_store=db, thread_id="llm-demo-conversation"),
)


def ask_prompt():
    prompt = "Hi, what can you do as an AI assistant?"
    print(llm.chat(prompt))
    raise StopIteration


App.run(ask_prompt)
```

## Methods

- **`chat(message, images=None)`**: Sends a message (with optional image file paths or raw bytes) and returns the complete response string. Blocks until generation is finished.
- **`chat_stream(message, images=None)`**: Returns a generator yielding response tokens as they arrive.
- **`stop_stream()`**: Interrupts an active streaming generation.
- **`with_memory(max_messages=10, persistence=None)`**: Enables history tracking. `max_messages` is the window size sent to the model. `persistence=True` enables persistence with a dedicated default database/thread; pass a `MessagePersistence` (e.g. `SQLMessagePersistence`) for full control.
- **`clear_memory()`**: Resets the conversation history (also deletes persisted rows for the active thread when a persistence backend is configured).
- **`list_models()`**: Returns the model identifiers available on the local inference service.
