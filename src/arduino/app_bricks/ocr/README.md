# OCR Brick

This OCR brick extracts the text visible in an image using the EasyOCR model
(CRAFT text detector plus CRNN recognizer) accelerated on the board's NPU. Given
an image it returns the recognized text in reading order, along with the position
and confidence of every detected text region.

The API is a single blocking call:

```python
from arduino.app_bricks.ocr import OCR

ocr = OCR()
result = ocr.extract_text("/path/to/photo.jpg")
print(result.text)
```

`extract_text` accepts a numpy array in BGR channel order (as returned by
`Camera.capture()`), the raw bytes of an encoded image file (e.g. JPEG or PNG),
or a path to an image file. It returns an `OcrResult`:

- `result.text` holds every recognized string joined by newlines, in reading
  order (top to bottom, left to right); it is empty when no text was found.
  `str(result)` yields the same text.
- `result.detections` lists one `TextDetection` per piece of text found, in
  reading order, each carrying the recognized `text`, the recognition
  `confidence`, the axis-aligned `bounding_box_xyxy` box and the `polygon` of
  the detected region — its 4 (x, y) vertices ordered top-left, top-right,
  bottom-right, bottom-left. Polygon and bounding box coincide for horizontal
  text; when the text is slanted, the polygon is the exact (rotated) region
  while the bounding box is the straight rectangle enclosing it.

Reading the text seen by a camera:

```python
from arduino.app_bricks.ocr import OCR
from arduino.app_peripherals.camera import Camera

ocr = OCR()
camera = Camera()
camera.start()

frame = camera.capture()
if frame is not None:
    result = ocr.extract_text(frame)
    for detection in result.detections:
        print(f"{detection.text} ({detection.confidence:.2f}) at {detection.bounding_box_xyxy}")
```

Tuning:

- `confidence` (constructor, overridable per call) drops detections whose
  recognition confidence is below the threshold and rebuilds `result.text` from
  the kept ones. Default is 0.3; pass 0.0 to report everything the model finds.
- `allowlist` (constructor, overridable per call) restricts recognition to the
  given characters, e.g. `"0123456789"` to read only digits from a meter or a
  serial number. It is applied by the model runner while decoding — the excluded
  characters cannot be emitted at all — so it improves accuracy on constrained
  text rather than just filtering the output. Pass `""` in a call to lift the
  restriction for that image only.

- `rotation` (constructor, overridable per call) also reads detected pieces of
  text rotated by the given angles (any of 90, 180, 270) and keeps the most
  confident reading, for photos where the text does not run left to right:
  vertical labels, an upside-down tag. Text is always read upright too; 90 and 270
  are only tried on regions taller than wide (that is what vertical text looks
  like), 180 on every region, and a rotated reading replaces the upright one only
  when it is clearly more confident. Each applicable angle costs one more recognizer pass
  per region, so leave it off when the orientation is known. Pass `[]` in a call
  to read upright only for that image. Phone photos usually need none of this:
  their EXIF orientation is applied when the image is decoded.

```python
from arduino.app_bricks.ocr import OCR

ocr = OCR(confidence=0.5)
reading = ocr.extract_text("/path/to/meter.jpg", allowlist="0123456789.")
print(reading.text)

sideways = ocr.extract_text("/path/to/page.jpg", rotation=[90, 270])
```

Image size: the model looks at the whole image scaled to 800x608, so a piece of
text has to be reasonably large in the frame to be found, roughly at least 1.5% of
the image height (a whole A4 page photographed from afar is beyond it: crop or get
closer). Sending more pixels does not change that, so the brick downscales images
larger than 2048 px on their longest side before sending them (JPEG, quality
lowered if needed to stay under the runner's 1 MiB message limit). Positions in the
result always refer to the image you passed in. A dense image with many pieces of
text takes longer: each detected region is one recognizer pass (about 15 ms on the
NPU), times the number of orientations.

Runner note: the model runner produces text metadata only — there is no annotated
video feed and no MJPEG stream. Calls are serialized and block until the runner
answers; `OCR(timeout=...)` bounds how long a call may wait (connection retries
while the container starts up included, 30 seconds by default). If the runner
cannot be reached in time, `extract_text` raises `OcrError`.
