name: Vibration Anomaly detection
description: |
  This Brick is designed for vibration anomaly detection and recognition, leveraging pre-trained models.
  It takes input from sensors (accelerometer) to identify possible anomalies based on vibration patterns.
  You can use it with pre-trained models provided by the framework or with your own custom anomaly detections models trained on the Edge Impulse platform.
