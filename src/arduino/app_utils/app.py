        stop() is brick or user code and may block for an arbitrarily long time, on a network
        call, an external process or a lock it does not own, and a Python thread cannot be
        interrupted. So when a deadline applies the call is dispatched to a short-lived daemon
        thread and abandoned if it overruns: that brick loses its clean stop, but the remaining
        bricks and, most importantly, the peripheral release still get their budget.

        A consequence worth knowing: during an app shutdown stop() no longer runs on the caller's
        thread, and a brick whose stop() overran may still be running while the next brick is
        stopped. stop_brick() keeps calling it synchronously.

        Args:
            brick: The brick to stop.
            deadline (float | None): Absolute time.monotonic() deadline, or None to call stop()
