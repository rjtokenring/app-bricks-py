"""Process-wide registry of peripherals that must be released when the application shuts down.

Peripherals (cameras, microphones, speakers, remote sensors) are not bricks, so nothing in the
brick lifecycle guarantees they are stopped. Some of them hold resources that outlive the
process: a CSI camera assigned by cam-server stays assigned to a dead client and becomes
unopenable host-wide until the service is restarted. The application must therefore release them
before the process goes away, and must do so within the container stop grace period.

The registry holds weak references only, so registering a peripheral never keeps it alive and
never interferes with the ``weakref.finalize()`` device-claim release installed by
``DeviceRegistry.bind()``.
