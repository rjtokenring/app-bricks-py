"""The container dependency graph declared in ci.json must match the Dockerfiles.

CI orders the builds from the `downstream` lists in `containers/*/*/ci.json` alone; the
Dockerfiles are what actually pull the images. Nothing links the two, so a Dockerfile that
starts to build `FROM` (or `COPY --from`) another container in this repo without the parent
listing it under `downstream` builds fine locally and then picks up a stale base in CI,
because its wave runs before - or alongside - the image it depends on.

These tests close that gap: every in-repo image reference in a Dockerfile must be a
declared edge, every declared edge must correspond to a reference, `sbom.runtime_base` must
name the image the final stage is built from, and the resulting plan must fit the number of
build waves the workflows actually have.
